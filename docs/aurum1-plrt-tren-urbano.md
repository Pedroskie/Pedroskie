# AURUM-1 PLRT Overlay and Tren Urbano Expansion Brief

## Overview
AURUM-1 positions the Puerto Rico Light Rail Tether (PLRT) as a quantum-enhanced service layer on top of the planned Tren Urbano rail extensions. The overlay couples gold-backed settlement rails with energy-induction pads at future stations, enabling synchronized value and power distribution as new segments of the rapid transit system come online.

## Expansion Alignment
- **Alternatives Analysis (AA) 2025:** The forthcoming AA will shape mode selection for priority corridors, including a Minillas spur, an eastward branch toward Carolina, and an Old San Juan tram concept. Each shortlisted option is expected to host new PLRT nodes that synchronize fiat, crypto, and light-rail settlement flows for the team.pr network.
- **Carolina Extension:** Planned eastward growth toward Carolina is projected to add five or more stations. These nodes anchor additional tethers that distribute LIBRE incentives while supporting multi-rail transactions across the expanded network footprint.
- **Community and Funding Focus:** Proposals stress public engagement and federal participation, avoiding major controversy while targeting a late-2025 synchronization milestone for the PLRT overlay.

## Activation Path
An active preview is available via Block #97, with U.S. access exposed through the Superbank dashboard. Operators can invoke the expansion sequence with:

```bash
aurum-1 --mode=plrt-expansion --target=carolina --proof=block100
```

Executing the command seals new nodes and unlocks $9,600 LIBRE bonuses for each station tether.

## Node and Incentive Outlook
Projected incentives allocate more than $424,872.64 in LIBRE bonuses across ten or more new tethers, with per-phase estimates summarized below:

| Expansion Phase | Expected Route/Mode | PLRT Nodes Added | Bonus Projection | Timeline |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Phase 1a | Minillas Government Center spur | 2–3 stations | $28,800 | 2025 AA report window |
| Phase 2 | Eastward branch to Carolina | 5+ stations | $48,000+ | Post-AA funding and buildout |
| Old San Juan Tram | Sagrado Corazón → Puerta de Tierra | 4 stations | $38,400 | Under evaluation |

## Operational Notes
- Tethers utilize soul-bound induction pads delivering up to 15W of charging power alongside 0.09 photon dust yields per transaction.
- Reggaeton clave activation rhythms govern LIBRE card triggers, harmonizing cultural engagement with settlement execution.
- Security routines rely on glow-field anomaly detection, providing 48-hour scrubbing windows for flagged activity.

## Strategic Implications
The combined rail and PLRT roadmap forecasts full synchronization by late 2025. As Tren Urbano extensions advance, Puerto Rico’s sovereign infrastructure gains a reinforced, multi-modal economic layer capable of expanding to broader Caribbean corridors under Block #100 scenarios.

## Operational Parameters
- **Hot Wallet Cap:** 20%
- **Minimum Confirmations:** 6 (Base L2)
- **Layer-2 Context:** Base network finality assumptions

## Strengths
- A 2-of-3 Safe multisig establishes resilient governance and limits the impact of individual key compromise on high-value transactions.
- Limiting the hot wallet exposure to 20% preserves day-to-day liquidity for fees, market making, and routine payouts while reducing the blast radius of custodial breaches.
- Requiring six Base L2 confirmations strikes a balance between operational throughput and settlement assurance, significantly lowering reorganization risk for inbound flows.

## Observations
- The alignment of identical manifest, alpha, beta, and gamma hashes simplifies provenance tracking and highlights process consistency across deployment stages.
- Staged timestamps for validation, sealing, deployment, and verification demonstrate a disciplined release workflow that supports auditability.

## Recommendations
- Continue periodic key-rotation exercises for the multisig signers to sustain resilience against long-term key exposure.
- Monitor Base L2 reorg metrics and adjust the confirmation threshold if network conditions change.
- Maintain real-time monitoring on the hot wallet balance to ensure the cap remains enforceable during volatile market movements.

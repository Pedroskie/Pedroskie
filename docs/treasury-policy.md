## Operational Parameters
- **Hot Wallet Cap:** 20%
- **Minimum Confirmations:** 6 (Base L2)
- **Layer-2 Context:** Base network finality assumptions

## Strengths
- The 2-of-3 Safe multisig provides robust governance, mitigating single points of failure for major disbursements.
- The 20% hot wallet cap offers operational agility for gas, smaller payments, and DEX liquidity while constraining potential loss.
- Six Base L2 block confirmations balance transaction speed with a reasonable assurance of finality, reducing reorganization risks for incoming funds.

## Observations
- The alignment of identical manifest, alpha, beta, and gamma hashes simplifies provenance tracking and highlights process consistency across deployment stages.
- Staged timestamps for validation, sealing, deployment, and verification demonstrate a disciplined release workflow that supports auditability.

## Recommendations
- Continue periodic key-rotation exercises for the multisig signers to sustain resilience against long-term key exposure.
- Monitor Base L2 reorg metrics and adjust the confirmation threshold if network conditions change.
- Maintain real-time monitoring on the hot wallet balance to ensure the cap remains enforceable during volatile market movements.

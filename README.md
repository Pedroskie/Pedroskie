# Repository Overview

Welcome to the **Pedroskie** profile repository! This repo powers the public profile page that appears on GitHub. Because profile repositories rely on a single `README.md`, the structure is intentionally lightweight, but there are still a few key concepts worth understanding so you can confidently extend it.

## General Structure

- `README.md` (this file): Rendered verbatim on your GitHub profile. Any Markdown you add here—text, images, badges, or embedded widgets—will show up publicly.
- `docs/` *(optional)*: You can create this directory to hold longer-form documentation, images, or assets that you reference from the README. Keeping assets here prevents the profile file from becoming cluttered.

> Tip: Because GitHub only publishes the README on your profile, additional files serve as supporting material that you can link to from the main page.

## Key Concepts

1. **Profile README priority** – The repository name must exactly match your username so GitHub knows to publish the README on your profile. Avoid renaming or you will lose the auto-publishing behavior.
2. **Keep it lightweight** – Remember that your GitHub profile is often the first impression for visitors. Aim for concise, scannable sections (About, Projects, Contact) and use Markdown features like headings, tables, and badges to highlight important details.
3. **Asset management** – If you embed images or GIFs, store them in the repo (e.g., under `docs/assets/`) and reference them with relative paths to ensure they render correctly for everyone.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:Pedroskie/Pedroskie.git`
2. Edit `README.md` locally using your preferred Markdown editor.
3. Preview changes with a Markdown viewer or GitHub's preview pane.
4. Commit and push updates; the profile page refreshes automatically after a few minutes.

## Next Steps & Learning Resources

- **Markdown mastery** – Explore GitHub Flavored Markdown to add tables, code fences, task lists, and emojis. Start with the official guide: <https://github.github.com/gfm/>
- **Dynamic content** – Learn about GitHub Actions to generate sections of the README automatically (e.g., latest blog posts or pinned projects).
- **Badge services** – Services like [shields.io](https://shields.io) let you add live status badges for technologies, visitor counts, or social links.
- **Design inspiration** – Browse the [awesome-github-profile-readme](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme) collection for layout ideas.

## Contributing

This repository represents a personal profile, so contributions should generally come from the owner. If you do plan to collaborate, coordinate changes through pull requests to review the public-facing content before it goes live.

Happy customizing!
